A slide puzzle built for [Flutter Challenge](https://flutterhack.devpost.com/).

*Built by [Very Good Ventures][very_good_ventures_link] in partnership with Google.*

*Created using [Very Good CLI][very_good_cli_link].*

## Preface 

This repo is based on a clone of the [flutter puzzle hack sample code](https://github.com/VGVentures/slide_puzzle) by VGV.

Some of my upcoming talks refer to this work. Despite publishing the sources here (required by the competition rules) 
I recommend studying the original source code at VGV
rather than my clone. The project was part of a competition submission with a hard deadline. Some
corners were cut.

## Deploy 1x1 version

Run this manually in console if github action is not triggered 

```sh
## deploy to live side
$ git checkout live
$ firebase use sliderpuzzle-flutter
## check that lib/firebase-options.dart is up to date
## flutterfire config
$ flutter build web
$ firebase deploy
```

## Go back to devel on main branch

```sh
## deploy to live side
$ git checkout main
$ firebase use sliderpuzzle-flutter-devel
$ flutterfire config
## debug locally
$ flutter build web
$ firebase deploy
```

## Getting Started üöÄ

To run the project either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter run -d chrome
```

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:very_good_slide_puzzle/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```
